/* Round every operation to double where the hardware computes wider.
 *
 * The correctly rounded code under libm/accurate needs each double operation
 * to round to double.  On x87 that is the FPU's precision control field, not
 * the compiler's business, so it takes an fldcw -- see glibc's
 * SET_RESTORE_ROUND_53BIT.  __FLT_EVAL_METHOD__ is 2 exactly where arithmetic
 * is carried out wider than the type; elsewhere this compiles to nothing.
 *
 * Wrap a whole function, not single expressions: fldcw flushes the FPU
 * pipeline, and the imported algorithms return from many places.
