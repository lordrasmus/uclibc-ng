   shmbuf}.h.  The generic layout in libc/sysdeps/linux/common/bits has it the
   other way round, which shifted every time field by one word: msgctl() and
   semctl() returned the always-zero upper half, so uClibc reported 1970.

   The structure is spelled out once per configuration rather than stitched
   together with conditionals inside it.  With a 32-bit time_t the field sits
   where the kernel's lower word is and the upper one is padding; with a 64-bit
   time_t the kernel's two words are kept as the pair it writes, _internal_1
   being the lower half, and msgctl()/semctl()/shmctl() compose the value
   behind the end of the kernel's structure as
   "_internal_1 | _internal_2 << 32".  */
